This is a simple city weather with charts.

How it works:

  1. User searches for any city in the search bar.
  2. After the search is complete, a chart showing temperature, weather and humidity should appear, it uses metric system of measure.

This little project was done using React, Redux Toolkit, Axios and Recharts.
The API used is from https://openweathermap.org/forecast5.

UI is not implemented as of now, will implement it in the future.
